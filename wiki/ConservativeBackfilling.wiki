#summary Definition of conservative backfilling, including design and implementation notes

See also the ListOfPapers and [Backfilling].

= Description =
In conservative backfilling, the scheduler will run jobs in their order of arrival (FIFO), and at any given moment will allow jobs to be [Backfilling backfilled] only if running them now will not delay the current latest start time of _*any*_ other job in the queue.

= Design =
The current design is based on Ahuva's CPU Time Slice design. See the code (see classes `CPUTimeSlice` and  `CPUSnapshot` in [http://pyss.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/schedulers/common.py common.py], and `ConservativeScheduler` in [http://pyss.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/schedulers/conservative_scheduler.py conservative_scheduler.py], repository revision 763).

We are currently exploring a simpler design based on the [SchedulerDesignInsights insights] gained with the EasyBackfilling scheduler design.
