#summary Insights gained while designing schedulers

= Maintaining history isn't necessary =
There will be a reporter observing all relevant events as they happen. It can record any events it cares about.

= Presenting future predictions isn't necessary =
In a real scheduler, at any given moment users may want to check when their jobs are expected to run at the latest.

In our simulations this ability isn't necessary. The only requirement is that jobs are started and stopped as they would be in a real environment.
