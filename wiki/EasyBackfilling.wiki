#summary Definition of EASY backfilling, including design and pseudocode

See also the ListOfPapers and [Backfilling], and especially [http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~feit/papers/SP2backfil01TPDS.ps.gz this paper], section 2.2, page 6.

= About =
EASY backfilling was developed by IBM and used in IBM's SP2 and !LoadLeveler products.

= Description =
In EASY backfilling, the scheduler may [Backfilling backfill] later jobs even if that delays the expected start time of other jobs, so long as the first job's expected start time isn't delayed.

= Pseudocode =
Taken straight from the [http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~feit/papers/SP2backfil01TPDS.ps.gz paper].

 # Find the shadow time and extra nodes 
   # Sort the list of running jobs according to their expected termination time 
   # Loop over the list and collect nodes until the number of available nodes is sufficient for the first job in the queue 
   # The time at which this happens is the _shadow time_
   # If at this time more nodes are available than needed by the first queued job, the ones left over are the extra nodes 
 # Find a backfill job 
   # Loop on the list of queued jobs in order of arrival 
   # For each one, check whether either of the following conditions hold: 
     * It requires no more than the currently free nodes, and will terminate by the shadow time, or
     * It requires no more than the minimum of the currently free nodes and the extra nodes
   # The first such job can be used for backfilling 

This is executed repeatedly whenever a new job arrives or a running job terminates, if the first job in the queue cannot start. In each iteration, the algorithm identifies a job that can backfill if one exists.
