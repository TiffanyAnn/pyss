# this test basically tests that the look_ahead choses to backfill a bunch of jobs with more processors 
# using the tie break rule that prefers jobs in the tail of the queue (that is "submitted later")
# the input variables: 
# arrival time; job id; user estimated duration; number of required nodes; actual duration
